# vertexai-cf-workers

## Prerequisites
1. **Sign up for a GCP account:**
   - Go to [https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and sign up for a GCP account.
   - You can get $150 free credits without a credit card, or $300 free credits by providing a credit card. (Note that the free credits expire in 90 days)

2. **Enable Vertex AI API:**
   - Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/aiplatform.googleapis.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/aiplatform.googleapis.com) to enable the Vertex AI API for your project.

3. **Apply for Claude models:**
   - Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and apply for access to the Claude models.

4. **Create a [Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account#step_index=1):**
   - Select the project ID you created earlier.
   - Make sure to grant the role of "Vertex AI User" or "Vertex AI Administrator" to the service account.
   - On the service account page you just created, go to the "Keys" tab and click "Add Key".
   - Select "Create new key" and choose "JSON" as the key type.
   - The key file will be downloaded automatically. This file contains the required variables for the worker, such as `project_id`, `private_key`, and `client_email`.

5. **Set up Cloudflare Workers:**
   - Follow Cloudflare's [Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) to deploy and configure your worker script.

## Workers Variables

The worker requires several environment variables to be set:

- `CLIENT_EMAIL`: This is the email associated with your GCP service account. You can find this in your service account's JSON key file.
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: This is the private key associated with your GCP service account. You can find this in your service account's JSON key file.
- `PROJECT`: This is the ID of your GCP project. You can find this in your service account's JSON key file.
- `API_KEY`: This is a string that you define. It is used to authenticate requests to the worker.

## Updating the HTML File

After setting up Cloudflare and GCP, you need to update the HTML file with the appropriate information:

1. **Update the API URL and Key in the JavaScript Code:**
   - In the `<script>` section of your HTML file, replace the placeholder for the API endpoint URL with the URL of your deployed Cloudflare Worker. For example:

     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch('https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev/v1/messages', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
             'Content-Type': 'application/json',
             'x-api-key': 'your-api-key-here',
             'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01'
         },
         body: JSON.stringify({
             model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
             messages: currentChat,
             max_tokens: 4096
         })
     });
     ```

   - Replace `'https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev/v1/messages'` with your actual Cloudflare Worker URL.

   - Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with the API key you defined for authentication.

2. **Ensure the API Key and Endpoint Match:**
   - Make sure that the API key and endpoint in your HTML code match those configured in your Cloudflare Worker and GCP settings.
  
3. **Run the HTML file**
   - Open the "claude-chat-interface-cloudflare.html" that you just edited from this repo and it should function if you did it right.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll ensure that the HTML file correctly interfaces with your Cloudflare Worker and GCP setup.
